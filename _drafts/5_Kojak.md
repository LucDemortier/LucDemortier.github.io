Yoga is a centuries-old practice that was started in India by ascetics who wanted to maintain good physical health during their long meditation sessions.  While it declined in its country of origin, over the past fifty years yoga took off in the West.  In fact, one of the founders of the modern yoga movement, B.K.S. Iyengar, is reported to have said that yoga was saved by the West.  How did we do this?  Well, we turned this revered practice into a business!  And now that it is a business, we can ask some pointed questions about it, and as data scientist maybe we can come up with some quantitative answers.

What motivates people to practice yoga?  What do they value in their practice?  What types of practice are there available?  What aspects of practice change with location?  How can we help people find their way in this world of yoga?  To answer these questions I looked at Yelp reviews of yoga businesses in the New York City and Los Angeles areas.
