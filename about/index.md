{% newthought 'A data scientist' %} {% marginfigure "Avatar" "assets/img/avatars/avatar.jpeg" ' ' %} with extensive background in experimental particle physics, I recently completed a 12-week data science bootcamp at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) in New York City, where I developed projects based on skills in programming, statistics, machine learning, communication, and design.

Before Metis I helped conduct two of the largest particle physics experiments in the world: [CDF](https://www-cdf.fnal.gov/) ("Collider Detector at Fermilab", at the Tevatron accelerator near Chicago, IL) and [CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) ("Compact Muon Solenoid", at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) near Geneva, Switzerland). While studying the large datasets produced by these experiments I was fortunate to be able to contribute to two of their most important discoveries: the top quark{% sidenote 1 'CDF Collaboration (F. Abe *et al.*), "Observation of top quark production in pbar-p collisions with the Collider Detector at Fermilab," [Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 2626 (1995)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.74.2626).' %} in 1995 and the Higgs boson{% sidenote 2 'CMS Collaboration (S. Chatrchyan *et al.*), "Observation of a new boson at a mass of 125 GeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC," [Phys. Lett. B 176, 30 (2012)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.021).' %} in 2012.

How do we extract information from observations?  As a particle physicist I wanted to make sure that my experiments did this correctly. I served on both the CDF and CMS "statistics committees", charged with promoting sound analysis methods and with communicating clear and unambiguous results.

I am passionate about understanding how to use data to test ideas, hypotheses, and models; how to visualize data and communicate its information content; and how to develop insight.  What can we ask, and how can we find an answer?
