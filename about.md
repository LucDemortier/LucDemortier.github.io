I am a data scientist with an extensive background in experimental particle physics. 
Currently I work at Metis New Economy Skills Training in NYC, going through a 12-week
data science bootcamp where I develop projects based on skills in programming, statistics,
machine learning, communication, and design.

### Previous experience...

For the previous thirty years I worked at two of the largest particle physics experiments
in the world: CDF ("Collider Detector at Fermilab", at the Tevatron accelerator near Chicago, 
IL) and CMS ("Compact Muon Solenoid", at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, Switzerland).
While studying the large datasets produced by these experiments I contributed to two of their
most important discoveries: the top quark in 1995 and the Higgs boson in 2012.

How do we extract information from observations?  As a particle physicist I worked to make sure
that my experiments did this correctly.  I was chairman of both the CDF and CMS "statistics
committees", which were charged with promoting sound analysis methods while advising and 
educating collaborators.

I am passionate about understanding how to use data to test ideas, 
hypotheses, and models; how to visualize data and communicate its information content; 
and how to develop insight.  What can we ask, and how can we find an answer?
