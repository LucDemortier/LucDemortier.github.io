As a carefully thought-out attempt to develop the objective side of Bayesian inference, reference analysis provides procedures for point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and the construction of objective posterior distributions. For physicists, the interest of these procedures lies in their very general applicability, their invariance under reparametrization, their coherence, and their good performance under repeated sampling.
