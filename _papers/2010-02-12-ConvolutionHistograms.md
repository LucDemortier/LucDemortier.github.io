We examine a generalization of a Monte Carlo procedure commonly used to model the missing transverse energy spectrum of {% m %}W\rightarrow\tau\nu{% em %} events. This procedure introduces correlations between spectrum bins, thereby invalidating the usual multinomial error structure. We compute the errors on the bin contents from first principles.
