For situations where we are trying to decide which of two hypotheses {% m %}H_{0}{% em %} and {% m %}H_{1}{% em %} provides a better description of some data, we discuss the usefulness of plots of {% m %}p_{0}{% em %} versus {% m %}p_{1}{% em %}, where {% m %}p_{i}{% em %} is the p-value for testing {% m %}H_{i}{% em %}. They provide an interesting way of understanding the difference between the standard way of excluding {% m %}H_{1}{% em %} and the {% m %}CL_{S}{% em %} approach; the "Punzi" definition of sensitivity; the relationship between p-values and likelihood ratios; and the probability of observing misleading evidence. They also help illustrate the Law of the Iterated Logarithm and the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox.
