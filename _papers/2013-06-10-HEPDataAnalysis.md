This is a review of interval construction methods, both frequentist and Bayesian.  The frequentist side covers Neyman's construction, test inversion, pivoting, asymptotic approximations, the bootstrap, and various techniques for handling nuisance parameters.  On the Bayesian side the discussion includes highest posterior density regions, equal-tailed intervals, upper and lower limits, likelihood regions, and lowest posterior loss regions.  Many examples are given to illustrate the concepts.  The review ends with a discussion of the role of intervals in search procedures in high energy physics.
