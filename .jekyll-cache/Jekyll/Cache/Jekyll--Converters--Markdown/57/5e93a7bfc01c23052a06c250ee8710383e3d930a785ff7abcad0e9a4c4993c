<p>Before Metis I helped conduct two of the largest particle physics experiments in the world: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_Detector_at_Fermilab">CDF</a> (‚ÄúCollider Detector at Fermilab‚Äù, at the Tevatron accelerator near Chicago, IL) and <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS</a> (‚ÄúCompact Muon Solenoid‚Äù, at the <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">Large Hadron Collider</a> near Geneva, Switzerland). While studying the large datasets produced by these experiments I was fortunate to be able to contribute to two of their most important discoveries: the top quark<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">CDF Collaboration (F. Abe <em>et al.</em>), ‚ÄúObservation of top quark production in pbar-p collisions with the Collider Detector at Fermilab,‚Äù <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.74.2626">Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 2626 (1995)</a>. </span> in 1995 and the Higgs boson<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">CMS Collaboration (S. Chatrchyan <em>et al.</em>), ‚ÄúObservation of a new boson at a mass of 125 GeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC,‚Äù <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.021">Phys. Lett. B 176, 30 (2012)</a>. </span> in 2012.</p>

<p>How do we extract information from observations?  As a particle physicist I wanted to make sure that my experiments did this correctly. I served on both the CDF and CMS ‚Äústatistics committees‚Äù, charged with promoting sound analysis methods and with communicating clear and unambiguous results.</p>

<p>I am passionate about understanding how to use data to test ideas, hypotheses, and models; how to visualize data and communicate its information content; and how to develop insight.  What can we ask, and how can we find an answer?</p>
