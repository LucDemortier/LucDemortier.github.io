I"—<p>For situations where we are trying to decide which of two hypotheses <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">H_{0}</script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">H_{1}</script></span> provides a better description of some data, we discuss the usefulness of plots of <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">p_{0}</script></span> versus <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">p_{1}</script></span>, where <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">p_{i}</script></span> is the p-value for testing <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">H_{i}</script></span>. They provide an interesting way of understanding the difference between the standard way of excluding <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">H_{1}</script></span> and the <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">CL_{S}</script></span> approach; the â€œPunziâ€ definition of sensitivity; the relationship between p-values and likelihood ratios; and the probability of observing misleading evidence. They also help illustrate the Law of the Iterated Logarithm and the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox.</p>
