I"=<p>We review, in some cases very succinctly, statistical issues in the formulation of discovery procedures for high energy physics. This includes alternatives to p-value tests, the look-elsewhere effect, measurement sensitivity, implicit statistical models, parton density uncertainties, reference priors, profile likelihood methods, and extreme value theory.</p>
