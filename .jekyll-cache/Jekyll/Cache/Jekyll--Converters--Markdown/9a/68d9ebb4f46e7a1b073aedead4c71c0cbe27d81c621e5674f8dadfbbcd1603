I"Q<p>We examine a generalization of a Monte Carlo procedure commonly used to model the missing transverse energy spectrum of <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">W\rightarrow\tau\nu</script></span> events. This procedure introduces correlations between spectrum bins, thereby invalidating the usual multinomial error structure. We compute the errors on the bin contents from first principles.</p>
