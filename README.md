# LucDemortier.github.io

This is the repository for my [website](http://lucdemortier.github.io/). It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Tufte](http://clayh53.github.io/tufte-jekyll/) theme.

I made slight modifications to address some issues:
* Reduced the width of the left margin;
* Changed the table layout to make it work in Firefox (however for large tables the only solution is to use HTML code instead of markdown);
* Reduced the font size of small-caps characters;
* Added social icons that are not available in the current version of Tufte-Jekyll.  For this I went to the [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/) website and generated font files from their [free collection](https://icomoon.io/#preview-free).

The source branch of this repository contains the files I edit.  The master branch contains the files generated by Jekyll.
